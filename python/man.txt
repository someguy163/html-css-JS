Soles of my shoes are worn
The knees on my jeans are torn
Sweat comin' through my shirt
Keep pushin' even though it hurts
I'm chasing what I know is true
There's nothing that I would not do
When everyone around me drops
I'm never gonna ever stop
I won't waste another minute
No I won't
I'm a man on a mission
I'm a man on a mission
I don't need no permission
I'm a man on a mission
I ain't waiting and wishin' (Take it up now, take it up now)
Oh I got that ambition (Take it up now, take it up)
I'm a man on a mission
When you look into my eyes
You know you're gonna see that fire
If you're standing in my way
It ain't gonna be your day
Bleed until I own this dream
Build it like you've never seen
Even at the mountain top
I'm never gonna ever stop
I won't wait another minute
No I won't
I'm a man on a mission
I'm a man on a mission
I don't need no permission
I'm a man on a mission
I ain't waiting and wishin' (Take it up now, take it up now)
Oh I got that ambition (Take it up now, take it up)
I'm a man on a mission
I won't wait another minute, no I won't
I won't wait another minute, no I won't
I won't wait another minute, no I won't, yeah (Whoa)
I won't wait another minute
No I won't
I'm a man on a mission
I'm a man on a mission
I don't need no permission
I'm a man on a mission
I ain't waiting and wishin' (Take it up now, take it up now)
Oh I got that ambition (Take it up now, take it up)
I'm a man on a mission
Take it up now, take it up
Take it up now, take it up
Take it up now, take it up
I'm a man on a mission
Take it up now, take it up
Take it up now, take it up
Take it up now, take it up
I'm a man on a mission
